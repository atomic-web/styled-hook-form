# grommet-hook-form
An smart React form built on top of `grommet`, `react-hook-form` and `react-context-api` and written completely in typescript.

# Motivation
In daily programming life, we developers always suffer from a very annoying phenomenon called boilerplate code and doing CRUD in react application is not an exception.With that said i've decided to craft something smart on top of cool react libraries to eliminate repeated code and provide developers with a base to immediately start creating fully functional forms without filling components with boilerplate callback and state management codes.

# Status
This library is still in the early days of development and is not production-ready. But of course, you can install and use it at your own risk.

# Installation and usage
Cancel changes
To start using this library issuing the following in you'r preferred terminal would be enough:

```
 yarn add gromet-hook-form  
```
or
```
 npm install gromet-hook-form 
```

There is no css dependency or whatsoever, so you won't be spending you'r precious minutes dealing with css monster 😃.
